# Twitter Crawler
Lab 2

What I decided to compare through my Twitter crawler was how word choice in Washington was different from the United States as a whole. I think this concept is interesting because Washington doesn't appear to have that different of a dialect or use of slang compared to the rest of the country. Toronto, for example, is a city that is very well known for its slang used there and so it's much easier to imagine how people will speak differently in Toronto compared to say British Columbia.

What's similar in both tweet maps is that the majority of tweets seem to come from coastal areas, where a majority of the population is. Looking at the maps, one way to make this comparison stronger may have been to alter the US region to exclude Washington. But again, the reason that these two maps make up different patterns is that the overall map contains all of the US. This means that when you look at the most commonly used words or phrases, it will be much more general. Smaller regional dialects should get drowned out by words used by the masses. The smaller scale Washington data covers a much smaller space and any dialects or different uses in words should be highlighted more.

The biggest difference between the word arts is that the Washington one contains a lot more geographical context. It, for whatever reason, has a lot of mentions of Portland, PDX, there are some mentions of sports teams like the Lakers. With mentions of police, pride, CEOs, and so on, there also seems to be a lot more personality to it. The US word art on the other hand just seems like a list of the most commonly used words in English. It's a lot harder to see any narratives or connections within it. These two contexts exist because the US word art considers the US as a whole, so all of the individual personalities within it get drowned out to find the words they use in common. The Washington dataset was much more regional and only had about 80 or so tweets to go off of, so I think more of people's messages were captured in it.
